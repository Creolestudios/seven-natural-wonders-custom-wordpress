# Introduction

- Seven Natural Wonders is committed to helping the global community discover, explore, and learn more about the natural wonders of the world.
- A potential “Wonder” status includes a World designation, a Continent designation, and a Country designation. 
- Global wonders will be included in a Country’s recognition of wonders, and they also serve as ambassador wonders to the Continent wonders.
- Each natural wonder represents statistical significance. 
- Whereas wonders at the World and Continent level are completely natural, wonders at the Country level may include the intersection between the natural and cultural.
